Apps are the components of django project. They are not apps like in mobile phones.

Dynamic Web Page: Having data stored in a database add to and we can see. i.e. interchange of data
For instance of instagram: When you post something into the instagram, you are adding something to its database.
For this purpose we have to build apps as they are called components.
1. Now, in the command prompt type: python manage.py startapp products i.e. it's a products application
2. The app has its own admin, views, models.
3. Include the app product to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'products',
]
