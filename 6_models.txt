1. Models allow us to store data in the database in a very specific way.
2. Class inside the models allow us to declare fields that are going to be mapped into the database. It's something logical for the data we need.

from django.db import models

# Create your models here.
class Product(models.Model):
    title = models.TextField()
    description = models.TextField()
    price = models.TextField()

3. Now, we have a new app products and new model.
4. The rule of thumb is whenever you change things in models.py, you have to do atleast two things. 
i) When the app is created, at least it should be included to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py
ii) We need to make sure that it is in our database.
iii) Also, if we make any changes to our models should be in the database.
5. These are the commands always you needed to run after we update models.py
i) python manage.py makemigrations

$ python manage.py makemigrations
Migrations for 'products':
  products\migrations\0001_initial.py
    - Create model Products
ii) python manage.py migrate

$ python manage.py migrate
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, products, contenttypes, sessions
Running migrations:
  Applying products.0001_initial... OK
6. Now, the database knows about this models and we can add other changes and do the migrations
7. We can view the models in django admin
8. Now, go to admin.py of the products app and update it

from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Product # relative import: importing class Product from models.py

# Register your models here.
admin.site.register(Product)

9. We have created a new product and it is saved in the database. 
Now, log into admin in django server add the products and view the products.
